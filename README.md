Overview:

This repository presents a numerical study of unsteady flow in an open channel following the rapid closure of a downstream control structure. The work focuses on understanding the propagation of disturbances generated by the sudden change in boundary conditions.

The study is designed for educational and research purposes, demonstrating the application of Lax Diffusive finite difference schemes for solving the Saint-Venant (shallow water) equations in open-channel hydraulics.

Problem Description (Original Interpretation) as adapted from 'Open Channel Flow' by M.H. Chaudhry (2022):

A long prismatic channel initially conveys steady, uniform flow. At the downstream end, a flow-control device is abruptly closed, generating a transient response that propagates upstream. The upstream boundary is connected to a constant-level reservoir, ensuring a fixed water surface elevation.

The objective is to analyze:

Temporal and spatial evolution of flow depth

Wave propagation and attenuation along the channel
